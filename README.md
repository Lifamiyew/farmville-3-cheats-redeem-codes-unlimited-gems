FarmVille 3 Animals Cheats unlimited gems redeem codes 2021-2022 that work iOS android tips - What do you do when there is not enough storage space? If your silo cannot hold more resources, you can continue to process customer orders at this time, which is a key function of Farmville 3. The guest's order may be optional, but it is highly recommended. This will involve sending orders for specific items by ship, which will give you experience points and monetary rewards. Therefore, if you have too many things in the silo / storage unit, you can check whether someone has an order and then trade, so that you can earn some extra money. 4. Why are tasks more important than guest orders? Although guest orders are the recommended way to free up storage space, you should give priority to your tasks rather than those guest orders. For example, tasks will give you more experience and allow you to move forward in the story, while getting some good freebies when you complete more tasks. By their nature, tasks and guest orders are very similar to each other, so you should not encounter too many problems in completing tasks as in executing guest orders. farmville 3 redeem codes 2022 unlimited gems
